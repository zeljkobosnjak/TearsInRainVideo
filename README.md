# 'Tears in Rain' Video Rental Store Project

## Overview
'Tears in Rain' stands as a beacon of simplicity. Crafted with Spring Boot, this video rental store system embraces the old-school charm of film rentals while wielding the modern might of Java. Named as a tribute to the poignant final moments of Roy Batty. "Blade Runner" remains etched in cinematic history â€” this system honors the brevity of existence. Roy Batty, model number N6MAA10816, a Nexus-6 combat model replicant, led a renegade group in search of more lifespan. Batty's lifespan spanned a mere 1,387 days. In every interaction, 'Tears in Rain' aims to capture the essence of making each moment count, just as Batty did.

## How to Run

- Navigate to the project directory
- Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the application
- Use Postman for testing

## Features
- Manage a film inventory
- Calculate rental prices, including late fees

## Tech Stack

**Java 17**: The fresh brew, the latest features without the jitters of legacy issues.

**Spring Boot**: Like a Swiss Army knife, Spring Boot slices through boilerplate and configures everything but morning coffee.

**Maven**: Our project's librarian, meticulously organizing our volumes of dependencies.

**Lombok**: The magician in the codebase, pulling getters, setters, and builders out of a hat with simple annotations.

**H2 Database**: In-memory database that's fast, disappearing and reappearing, like a ninja.

## Decisions

- **Domain-Driven Design** - embraced to ensure our code mirrors the real-world model of our video store
- **Entity separation**: - each entity (`Film`, `Customer`, `Rental`) was crafted to represent distinct real-world concepts
- **Service layer abstraction**: - service interfaces (`FilmService`, `RentalService`, `CustomerService`), we've ensured that our business logic promotes scalability
- **Repository Pattern**: - data access, it decouples the business logic from the data layer, making our data queries a breeze to test and evolve
- **Custom exceptions**: - handle specific domain errors
- **Lombok integration**: - keep our code DRY and clean
- **In-memory database**: - for development ease, reflecting the transient nature of... :)
